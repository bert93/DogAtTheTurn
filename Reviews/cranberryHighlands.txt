  title: Cranberry Highlands - Dog At The Turn's Maiden Review
  content: This is my first official review and I don't want to come out of the
  gate too hot but Cranberry came to play. I made the turn after parring 9
  from a fairway bunker (sick) and was pretty fired up to scarf down a dog and get these
  reviews going. First things first, it came straight off the roller - I'm not sure how
  long it was sitting there but a roller is typically a better sign of what's to come
  than the dirty dog water some courses have. The cashier was very friendly, as was
  the other one I had had to start the round, which is always a plus and puts you in the
  right mindset for maximum DATT enjoyment. They also had all of the condiments I was looking
  for in individual packages, presumably due to coronavirus. I prefer a squeeze bottle or
  dispenser for ease of use but I'm certainly not gonna knock them for trying to be hygienic.
  The dog itself was excellent: classic, tasty hot dog flavor, a nice crunch, and it was big
  so I felt satisfied and satiated but not so full that I couldn't enjoy a couple of additional
  libations on the back 9. The bun was fine. They didn't toast it or anything exciting but it
  served its purpose as the vessel for the dog and didn't get in the way. Overall I'm giving
  Cranberry Highland's Dog At The Turn a 7.9. A fine, gentleman's dog that helped kick-start
  a delicious back 9 at Cranberry. Consider the bar set.
