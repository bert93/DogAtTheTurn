This is an interesting review. One that I wasn't sure I should write for a few reasons,
mainly that I didn't actually eat the dog at the turn or even on the golf course; I ate it right
after at the Rolling Rock Club pool. This left me with quite the philosophical conundrum - is a
Dog At The Turn valid if it's not a dog at the turn? Is a hot dog simultaneously at the turn
and not at the turn until you get to the turn? Did I just invent the concept of Schr√∂dinger's
Hot Dog? Wow...deep. Ultimately, I decided to write and post this review because, after careful consideration,
it was most definitely part of my golf experience that day and it would be silly
